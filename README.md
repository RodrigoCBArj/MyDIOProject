## Testing Methodologies

### Agile Testing

Agile testing emphasizes collaboration and flexibility. It aligns testing with development cycles, allowing for quick feedback and adjustments. The project provides tools and strategies to integrate testing into agile workflows effectively.

### BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

BDD is a collaborative approach that involves stakeholders in the testing process. It focuses on defining the behavior of the software through user stories and scenarios. This project includes BDD test cases that help ensure the software meets user expectations.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing remains a critical aspect of quality assurance. This project outlines step-by-step test cases to guide testers through the process. It ensures thorough validation of features before release.

## User Stories

User stories form the backbone of the testing process. They provide context and help define the requirements from the user's perspective. Here are some examples of user stories included in this project:

- **As a user**, I want to be able to log in to my account so that I can access my profile.
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password if I forget it, ensuring I can always access my account.
- **As a user**, I want to receive notifications for important updates to stay informed.

These stories guide the creation of relevant test cases.

## Test Cases

The project includes a comprehensive set of test cases that follow a step-by-step format. Each test case includes:

- **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
- **Description**: A brief overview of what the test case verifies.
- **Preconditions**: Any requirements that must be met before executing the test.
- **Steps**: Detailed instructions for executing the test.
- **Expected Result**: The expected outcome of the test.

### Example Test Case

**Test Case ID**: TC001  
**Description**: Verify user login functionality.  
**Preconditions**: User must have a valid account.  
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the login page.
2. Enter a valid username and password.
3. Click the "Login" button.  
**Expected Result**: User is redirected to the dashboard.

## Bug Tracking

Bug tracking is a vital part of the QA process. This project outlines the bug life cycle, which includes:

1. **Identification**: Discovering and reporting bugs.
2. **Classification**: Categorizing bugs based on severity and impact.
3. **Resolution**: Fixing the bugs and retesting.
4. **Verification**: Ensuring the bug is resolved and does not reoccur.

### Tools for Bug Tracking

While this project does not endorse specific tools, common bug tracking tools include:

- JIRA
- Bugzilla
- Trello

Choose a tool that fits your team's workflow.
